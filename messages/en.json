        "question": "What is an RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial)?",
        "answer": "An RCT (Randomized Controlled Trial) is the gold standard in scientific research. Participants are randomly assigned to two groups: one receives the supplement and the other a placebo. This eliminates bias and determines if the supplement actually works."
      },
      "missing_info": {
        "question": "Why do some supplements have no information?",
        "answer": "If we don't find information on a supplement, it may be because:\n\n1. The name is misspelled (try variations)\n2. It's a very new product with no published studies\n3. No scientific studies exist in PubMed for that compound\n4. It's a brand name (try searching for the active ingredient)\n\nWe never generate false information. If there are no studies, we tell you clearly."

      "why_products": {
        "question": "Why do you recommend these specific products?",
        "answer": "Product recommendations are NOT based on advertising or special fees.

        "answer": "Yes, we are transparent about this. Some links are affiliate links, meaning we may receive a small commission if you buy through them (at no extra cost to you). This allows us to keep the service free and continue improving the platform."

      },
      "adverse_reaction": {
        "question": "What if I have an adverse reaction?",
